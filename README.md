## Naturalistic Emotion Processing Analysis

Authors: Jivesh Ramduny & Clare Kelly

### Overview

We leverage an emotional evocative movie to study the brain function at multiple spatial and temporal scales in addition to its phenotypic relevance with depressive symptom severity and emotion regulation strategies in a community-based sample of 50 female adolescents enriched for depressive symptoms. The aims of the study are three-fold:

(1) to investigate whole-brain full-length and moment-to-moment brain synchrony during naturalistic emotional viewing, and explore its relationships of each with self-reported depressive symptom severity and emotion regulation strategies;
(2) to examine static and dynamic functional connectivity within an a priori emotion regulation network;
(3) to characterise the underlying stimulus-evoked brain activity using the Hurst Exponent and to explore associations with the phenotypic measures at the network and ROI level.
